<h1>LASER SYSTEM</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>LASER System was developed for LASER Electronics by <a href='https://maleeshaachintha.me' target="blank">T. A. Maleesha Achintha</a>. I have been developing this since 2018 myself. The main forms and database of this system were developed within one year and this system is still updated.</p>

<p>This company repairs and sells electronic items. Customers gave broken electronics to one of the cashiers in this company. The cashier enters customer details and product details and prints a received invoice and repair sticker using this system. The received bill handovers to the customer and the repair-sticker pastes on the product. After the cashier handovers to one of the technicians, The technician fixes the product and enters the repair charge relevant repair no using technician's website. The system sends messages to customers whose the given repair has been repaired. Then, the customer comes with the received bill. After the customer paid the related charge, the system prints the delivered invoice.</p>

<p>LASER system was developed for both admins and cashiers. The cashier can do the things that admins also is able. If the cashier changes the restriction data, the relative SQL commands send with the changed date, user to admins without applying database. The admin checked the data and apply using the admin's web page. Microsoft Office Access was chosen as a Local database because it is easy to use and fast. LASER System has a background worker program. This program updates the online Mysql database, sends the emails, sends SMS messages and backups the local database. </p>

<p>Technician salary calculates using the equation written below.</p>

<h4>Monthly Technician Salary = (((Total of paid charges of Repairs and RE-Repairs) - (Total of Technician Cost) )/2) - (Total of Technician Loan)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Technician Cost means the cost for repaired product. 
        <p>Ex: ICs, Transistors, etc.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Technician loan means the money that gave before the salary date or the stock that is not for the repairing product.
        <p>Ex: Soldering Iron Bouths, LED Bulbs, etc.</p> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Repair Advanced means the money given before the repair is completed by Customers.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
